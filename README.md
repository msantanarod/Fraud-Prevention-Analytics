# Fraud Prevention Analytics Repository
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
The purpose of this repository is to gather all my projects related to fraud prevention analysis:

## Credit card Fraud Detection:
This is the first fraud prevention data analysis project. Its goals are the following:
<ol>
  <li>Define the concept of "Fraud".</li>
  <li>Explain how Fraud Prevention analysts caught fraudulent transactions before Machine Learning (ML) became a frequent tool in fraud prevention.</li>
  <li>Develop a ML model with the highest recall value as possible.</li>
</ol>

ðŸ“ˆ **Data**: we will use the dataset (Credit Card Fraud Detection) from Kaggle. 
the database consists of 284.807 transactions made by credit card in two different days in September 2013, where only 492 of them are marked as fraud. All variables are numeric, and features from "V1" to "V28" are the result of PCA transformation. Only two feautures were not transformed with PCA: "Time" and "Amount". The feature "Class" is our target variable and it has two possible values:
<ul>
  <li>1= fraud</li>
  <li>0= non-fraud</li>
</ul>

ðŸ”¬ **Methodology**: Python is the primary tool for the data analysis and visualization. Morever, Github shall be used for Project management.
